### ðŸ‘‹  Hello, I am Dylan Bulmer! 

I am an Entrepreneur :man_office_worker: Software Engineer :computer: Privacy Researcher :man_scientist: and Trumpeter :trumpet: from **Maine**. 

Right now, I'm working as a full-time as a software engineer and in my free time I'm doing everything from hiking, mentoring individuals and startups, guest lecturing at my alma matar, working on various side projects, and much more!

### My on-going projects
This list isn't inclusive, but a couple of my projects I'd like to point out are:

[**@dylanbulmer/openapi**](/DylanBulmer/openapi), a lightweight middleware that can help organize and build out your API documentation faster. With the help of TypeScript, you are informed immediately when your API documentation is malformed before building and running!

[**Codr**](/CodrJS), an open-sourced, customizable, and scalable, annotation tool that provides researchers a secure place to upload and annotate hundreds of thousands of samples, export, and then use the result to train ML models and more.
